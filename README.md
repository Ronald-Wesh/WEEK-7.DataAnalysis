# Data Analysis and Visualization Project

This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization using Python, focusing on the Iris dataset. The script performs various analyses and creates multiple visualizations to understand the dataset better.

## Features

- Data loading and exploration
- Basic statistical analysis
- Multiple visualizations including:
  - Line plot
  - Bar chart
  - Histogram
  - Scatter plot

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the script using Python:
```
python data_analysis.py
```

The script will:
1. Load and explore the Iris dataset
2. Perform basic statistical analysis
3. Create visualizations
4. Save the visualizations as 'iris_analysis.png'

## Output

The script will display:
- First few rows of the dataset
- Dataset information and structure
- Missing values analysis
- Basic statistics
- Mean values by species

A visualization file named 'iris_analysis.png' will be created containing four different plots:
1. Line plot showing petal length over samples
2. Bar chart showing mean petal length by species
3. Histogram showing the distribution of sepal length
4. Scatter plot showing the relationship between sepal length and petal length
